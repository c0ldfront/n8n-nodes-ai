## üñ•Ô∏è Installing via n8n Community UI

While `n8n-nodes-ai` aims to be included in future n8n releases, you can currently install and use its features directly via n8n's community node integration. This allows you to leverage its latest features and models that may not yet be available in the default n8n package.

### Community Node Installation (Recommended)

1. Navigate to `Settings` within your n8n instance.
2. Choose the `Community Nodes` section.
3. Click on `Install`.
4. In the field labeled `Enter npm package name`, type `n8n-nodes-ai`.
5. Acknowledge the risks associated with installing community nodes by selecting `I understand the risks of installing unverified code from a public source`.
6. Finally, click on `Install`.

Once installed, `n8n-nodes-ai` will be available alongside other nodes in your n8n instance. You can easily find and integrate them within your workflows using the Nodes panel's search functionality.

## üê≥ Installing via Docker

If you're running `n8n` within a Docker container, you can integrate the `n8n-nodes-ai` nodes by extending the official n8n Docker image. Here's how:

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Dockerfile Creation:** Begin by creating a Dockerfile to extend the n8n image:

    ```Dockerfile
    FROM n8nio/n8n

    # Install the n8n-nodes-ai package
    RUN npm install -g n8n-nodes-ai
    ```

2. **Building the Image:** Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and build your custom image:

    ```bash
    docker build -t custom-n8n .
    ```

3. **Run n8n with Custom Nodes:** Once the image is built, run n8n using your custom image:

    ```bash
    docker run -it --rm \
      --name n8n \
      -p 5678:5678 \
      custom-n8n
    ```

4. **Access n8n:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5678/`. You should now see `n8n-nodes-ai` nodes available alongside the default nodes in the n8n editor.

5. Start integrating the powerful capabilities of `n8n-nodes-ai` into your n8n workflows!

**Note:** Always ensure your Docker setup and configurations align with your deployment environment's specifics. This guide provides a general approach suitable for local development and testing.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing via Local CLI

For those who prefer command-line installations or are looking to integrate `n8n-nodes-ai` into their development workflows, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have `n8n` already installed. If not, you can install it globally:
    ```bash
    npm install n8n -g
    ```

2. With `n8n` set up, you can now install the `n8n-nodes-ai` package:
    ```bash
    npm install n8n-nodes-ai
    ```

3. Once the installation completes, you'll have the `n8n-nodes-ai` nodes available to use in your n8n instance.

4. To verify the nodes' availability, start your n8n instance and search for the nodes within the n8n editor.

5. Begin crafting and optimizing your workflows with the expansive capabilities that `n8n-nodes-ai` brings to your automation suite.
